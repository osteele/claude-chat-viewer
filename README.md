## Usage

Visit [tools.osteele.com/claude-chat-viewer](https://tools.osteele.com/claude-chat-viewer) to use the application.

### Viewing Individual Conversations

1. Export your Claude chat as JSON
2. Click "Enter JSON" in the viewer or use the "Upload File" button
3. Paste your JSON or select a file
4. View your conversation in a clean, readable format

### Viewing Multiple Conversations

The viewer supports Claude's full data export in two ways:

#### Option 1: Direct ZIP Upload (Recommended)
1. Request a data export from Claude (Settings â†’ Account â†’ Request Export)
2. Download the ZIP archive when ready
3. Click "Upload File" and select the ZIP directly - no extraction needed!
4. Browse through all your conversations with summaries
5. Select any conversation to view in detail
6. Use the header navigation to switch between conversations

#### Option 2: Upload conversations.json
1. Extract the Claude export ZIP
2. Upload the `conversations.json` file using the "Upload File" button
3. Browse and select from your conversations

### Loading Files via URL Parameter

In development mode, you can load files directly via URL parameter:

```
# Single conversation
http://localhost:5173/?file=inputs/chat.json

# Multiple conversations
http://localhost:5173/?file=inputs/data/conversations.json
```

This is particularly useful for:
- Development and testing with sample data
- Sharing specific conversation files
- Automating the viewer with pre-loaded content

### Downloading Artifacts

Click the "Download Artifacts" button to download all code snippets and artifacts as a zip file. The downloaded archive will:
- Maintain file extensions based on language or MIME type
- Preserve directory structure from file paths
- Include all code snippets and tool outputs from the conversation
- Name files based on their titles or content

### Copying Conversations

Click the "Copy conversation" button to copy the entire conversation to your clipboard. The copied text will:
- Preserve formatting when pasted into rich text editors (like Google Docs or Word)
- Include proper formatting for code blocks with monospace font
- Fall back to clean plain text when pasted into plain text editors

### Printing

Use your browser's print function to create a PDF or paper copy. The viewer automatically formats the conversation for printing.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + V` - Paste JSON
- `Tab` - Navigate between elements
- `Enter` - Activate buttons and controls
