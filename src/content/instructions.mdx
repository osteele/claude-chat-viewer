View your Claude conversations in a clean, readable format. Upload your entire Claude archive to browse and search through all your conversations, or paste individual chats for quick viewing.

## Choose your import method

### Option A: Upload ZIP Archive <span className="easiest-badge">Easiest</span>
1. Get your archive from Claude: **Settings → Account → Request Export**
2. When you receive the download link, **upload the ZIP file directly**
3. Browse and search through all your conversations with filtering options

### Option B: Upload conversations.json
Already extracted your archive? Upload the **conversations.json** file to browse and search your entire conversation history.

### Option C: Paste Individual Conversation
Export a single chat from Claude and paste the JSON here.
See [Convert Claude JSON to Markdown] for instructions on using the browser developer console to extract the JSON for a chat.

**Note**: Due to technical limitations in the Anthropic API, the app cannot
currently render image attachments. Also, it does not currently render LaTeX or
run artifacts.

**Privacy**: This app runs entirely in your browser. Your conversations and files never leave your computer. The app is served as static files with no backend server—we cannot see, store, or access any of your data. The only network requests are loading the app itself.

**More Tools**: Check out my [other web applications](https://osteele.com/software/web-apps/) and [AI & LLM tools](https://osteele.com/topics/ai).
