# Claude Chat Viewer

Paste a [Claude chat](https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts) JSON export file
here to see the conversation in a readable format.

See [Convert Claude JSON to Markdown] for instructions on how to find the JSON
for a Claude chat, so that you can paste it here.

**Note**: Due to technical limitations in the Anthropic API, the app cannot
currently render image attachments. Also, it does not currently render LaTeX or
run artifacts.

**Acknowledgements** This app was *inspired* by Simon Willison's [Convert Claude JSON to Markdown]
tool, and (largely) *written* by [Cursor](https://cursor.com) and
[Claude](https://anthropic.com).
